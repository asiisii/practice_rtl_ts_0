Manual Queries

RTL Queries
  - getBy & getAllBy
  - queryBy & queryAllBy
  - findBy & findAllBy

manual queries = you can use the regular querySelector DOM API to find elements

const {container} = render(<MyComponent />)
const foo = container.querySelector('[data-foo="bar"])

even though we can do it we should avoid it as classname, id are not visible to users and its not the best practice to test it this way
